# Reactrix GDPR-Compliant Event Sourcing Framework

[![License](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/reactrix)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

Reactrix is an opinionated [Event Sourcing] framework with a supplementary
[Event Store] written in [Rust]. It solves the conundrum of guaranteed integrity
of events versus [the right to be forgotten], as required by the European [GDPR].

The project is an early work in progress and APIs are changing, so it's not
considered for public consumption, yet.
